My wife and I have been enjoying this one lately and it is fantastic. If you are a high-acheiver or have ever considered yourself a "perfectionist," there are lots of great insights on how to become what the author calls an "optimalist", or an individual who is still driven and high-acheiving but who is not crippled by the fear of failure.
