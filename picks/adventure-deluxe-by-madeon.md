I have been on an electronic music kick for the last few years. But I am pretty picky about which electronic music I will listen to; it has to have good vocals, meaningful melodies, and favor thoughtfulness over repetition. (Basically, I want to have my cake and eat it, too, OK?) This album absolutely hits the nail on the head with all of the above. I have listened to it dozens of times since its release.
