According to [one of the Mormon Church's official websites](http://mormon.org):


> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the official name of the religion commonly called the Mormon Church. We believe first and foremost that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world and the Son of God.
>
> While our backgrounds and experiences are diverse, Mormons are united by a commitment to Jesus Christ.

The story behind the Mormon Church is remarkably simple and powerful. Be sure to check out [a brief history of the Church](http://mormon.org/beliefs/restoration) and [a succinct description of the Church's core doctrines](http://mormon.org/beliefs/jesus-christ). Good stuff.
