I very recently graduated from Brigham Young University with a master's degree in Information Systems Management. In one of my final class sessions, a professor showed us this video and asked us to reflect on what our education means to us. As the video points out, we have the power to *truly think*, to choose what has meaning and what doesn't in the mundane moments of everyday life. The video is made from a speech given ten years ago, but the message is a timeless gem.
