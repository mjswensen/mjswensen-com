As millions of members of the Church of Jesus Christ around the world study the Book of Mormon together this year, I have been impressed by how similar the challenges, attitudes, and behaviors are between the ancient people in the record and people today.

This week we study an exchange between Alma, a reformed trouble maker who has become the leader over the ancient Church in that area, and Korihor, a self-proclaimed "Anti-Christ." Alma and Korihor pre-date the life of Jesus Christ, so their discussion revolves around whether or not a Christ would come. Note Korihor's key arguments as he contends with Alma:

* [To believe in Christ is a burden, and a ridiculous and pointless one at that.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.p13#p13)
* [No one can know the future.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.p13#p13)
* [These beliefs are just tradition, nothing more.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.p14#p14)
* [One can't _know_ things that one can't _see_.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.p15#p15)
* [Church leaders' primary objective is to gain wealth and keep others from enjoying life.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.p27#p27)
* [God has never been seen or known.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.p28#p28)

Sound familiar? These similar to ideas that are very widespread in the modern world; thoughts shared by non-believers and even believers from time to time. Take a look at Alma's rebuttals:

* [Church leaders work to support themselves financially.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.p32-p34#p32)
* [I know that there is a God, and that Christ will come.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.p39#p39)
* [There is no evidence that there is not a God.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.p40#p40)
* [There is, however, much evidence of God's existence: scriptures, prophets, Earth, animal and plant life, space, planets, science, etc.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.p44#p44)

Korihor tells Alma he will change is mind if Alma can provide proof of God's power. To see how the story ends, read [verses 43-60 of chapter 30 of the book of Alma in the Book of Mormon.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.p43-p60#p43)

There are lots of interesting things to learn from this account, but if anything, we learn that we've been here beforeâ€”humans in ancient times are similar to us now, therefore **we can learn from their experience to better ourselves and our world.**
