If I had to boil it down to a single, generalized reason, it would be this: I like and trust Apple more than Google. Why? *Because Apple's business is not dependent on my personal data.* Let's take a closer look.

1. I don't have anything to hide.
2. I generally don't care about data privacy.

Disclaimer number one above is the typical response people have when asked about their views
