When life's challenges affront us, the superfluity of daily life suddenly loses its meaning.

My wife and I are the parents of one child, a nearly two-year-old boy. He is our first child, and we are therefore a little clueless when it comes to parenting (me much more so than my wife). This week he managed to come down with what was later found to be a gastrointestinal bug of some sort, with an ear infection and cold on top of that. When he woke up with a 105&deg; fever, we rushed him to the pediatrician's office. He was dehydrated, and was admitted to the hospital that night. Since this was our first bout with any health-related issues for our son, one can hopefully understand that we felt anxious and worried. Fortunately, after taking in some fluids intravenously he began to recover without a problem. The point of the story is not the ending, but what happened during the difficult experience.

We were overwhelmed

* we need a close-knit community. the mormon church serves my family quite well in this regard. Since it is a global church, no matter where we travel or relocate to there is a warm community there to welcome us.
